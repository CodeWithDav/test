       <h1> Batman is a superhero who appears in American 
        comic books published by DC Comics.
         Batman was created by the artist Bob Kane and writer
          Bill Finger, and debuted in the
          27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on 
          March 30, 1939.
          In the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce
           Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
           philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in
            Gotham City.
           His origin story features him swearing vengeance against
            criminals after witnessing
            the murder of his parents,
            Thomas and Martha, as a child, a vendetta
             tempered by the ideal of justice.
             He trains himself physically and intellectually, 
             crafts a bat-inspired persona, and
              monitors the Gotham streets at night.
              Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
               Batman with supporting characters, including his
               sidekicks Robin and Batgirl;
               allies Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordon; 
               love interest Catwoman; and foes such as the
                Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy,
                 the JOKER.</h1>
